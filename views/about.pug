    ul
      li Code: the code for the type of event
      li Description: A brief description of what happened.
      li Solution: A brief description of how the problem was solved. The more details you give the more useful this tool will be for trouble shooting in the future.
      li Date and Time: Date and time where the event took placeof day.
      li Duration: total downtime in hours.
    h5 TABLE
    ul
      li Each column on the main page can be used for sorting the downtime table.
      li The main search bar is not case sensitive and matches what you type in with the data contained in any of the columns and treats whitespaces as wildcards. You can type in searchterms related to different parameters as long as they are separated by whitespace.
      li The column headers are also search bars, but they only apply to their respective columns.
      li below the table are four fields you can use for range specific searches. Say you are only interested in date within a certain range or events which cause downtime of a certain magnitude.
